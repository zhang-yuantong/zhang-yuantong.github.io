Suppose there are $N$ snails and we number them through 1 to $N$, and surprisingly their speed is eactly the same as their number: snail No.1 has a speed of 1m/s, snail No.2 has a speed of 2m/s and etc. Then we randomly place them on a one way road and they start moving. If a fast snail encounter a slow snail, the fast one will reduce the speed and they form a group of snail. If a snail just has a speed that no snail can chase it and it cannot chase any other snail, then it form a group of snail by itself. After a really really long time, how many group of snail will form?

The answer is $$\sum_{n=1}^N \frac{1}{n}$$ Let's break it down step by step!

We just need to consider how many **leader** there will be so we can figure out how many groups will finally be formed. 
- The first snail (by location) will always leads a group.
- The probability of the second snail leading a group, which is the same as the probability that the second snail is slower than the first one, is $\frac{1}\{2}$
  - Just a probability trick: for any two random numbers a and b, the probability that a is greater than b is, by symmetry, 1/2.
  - Or you can validate this by calculation:
    - If the first snail is No.100, then among all 99 snails left, the probability that the second snail is slower is 99/99,
    - If the first snail is No.99, then among all 99 snails left, the probability that the second snail is slower is 98/99,
    - $\cdots$
    - Combine all these case, the probability the the first snail is No.100 is 1/100

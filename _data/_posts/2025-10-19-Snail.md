Suppose there are $N$ snails and we number them through 1 to $N$, and surprisingly their speed is eactly the same as their number: snail No.1 has a speed of 1m/s, snail No.2 2m/s and etc. Then we randomly place them on a one way and the start moving. After a really really long time, how many group of snail will form?

The answer is $$\sum_{n=1}^N \frac{1}{n}$$

There are bios, profiles, and resumes — but this is About, so let’s skip the formalities.

I’m Victor: trader by trade, researcher by habit, coder by compulsion, and occasional academic when the stars (and deadlines) align. I hold degrees in Economics from UC San Diego and Duke University, with just enough math and statistics to make things complicated on purpose.

Right now, I’m working at China Galaxy Securities, where I wrangle the valuation of OTC derivatives — mostly options and swaps. It's not exactly my passion project, but it keeps the models running and the neurons firing.

I’ve built alpha factors, stress-tested trading strategies, and dabbled in machine learning just enough to know it’s never as smart as it thinks it is. I like fast code, clean models, and messy problems.

This is me (yes, of course Photoshopped).
